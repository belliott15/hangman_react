# Hangman

## Using React and Next js to spin up the app

- Once on the page you will have the option to start a new game
- If a new game is started you will be given a random selection of letters generated from a list of words
- A keyboard will appear at the bottom of screen along with a gallows above the keyboard
- When a key is clicked the key will turn red if the guess was incorrect or it will turn green
- If the guess is correct the gallows will stay the same
- if the guess is incorrect the gallows will fill with parts of a stick figure body
